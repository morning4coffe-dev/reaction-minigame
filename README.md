# Uno.ReactionMinigame

A cross-platform **Reaction Challenge** minigame built with the [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno).

The application is a reaction-time game where the user must click a randomly sized and positioned **red ellipse 15 times** as quickly as possible, after a 3-second countdown. The player must sign in with a name and email before starting, and their final time is saved to a local leaderboard.
